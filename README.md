This coursework implements and compares sequential vs parallel versions of 
Bubble Sort and Merge Sort algorithms in C using pthread.

### Algorithms Implemented
1. **Sequential Bubble Sort** - O(n²) complexity with early termination
2. **Sequential Merge Sort** - O(n log n) divide-and-conquer algorithm
3. **Parallel Bubble Sort** - Odd-even transposition with custom macOS barriers
4. **Parallel Merge Sort** - Divide & conquer with hierarchical merging# enterprise-coursework
